# A14SId Assignment: AI for Early Detection of Acute Malnutrition in Northern Nigeria

## Problem Statement
In northern Nigeria, early detection of acute malnutrition in children under 5 is severely limited by infrequent screenings, overburdened health workers, ongoing insecurity, and access barriers in rural and conflict-affected areas. As of September 2026 projections, approximately **6.4 million children aged 0-59 months** are expected to suffer from acute malnutrition (including ~2 million with Severe Acute Malnutrition - SAM). This contributes to malnutrition being linked to around **45% of under-5 deaths** in the region, with only about **20% treatment coverage** for SAM cases.

## Target Users and Beneficiaries
- **Primary**: Mothers and caregivers of children under 5 in high-burden northern states (e.g., Borno, Sokoto, Katsina, Yobe, Zamfara).  
- **Secondary**: Frontline health workers (Community Health Extension Workers - CHEWs/JCHEWs, nurses/midwives at Primary Health Centers - PHCs, Community Health Officers - CHOs) who perform screenings and referrals.  
- **Institutional**: Federal Ministry of Health (FMOH), State Ministries of Health (SMOH), National Primary Health Care Development Agency (NPHCDA), and State PHCDA for aggregated data insights and planning.  
- **Indirect**: The children themselves (preventing deaths and long-term disabilities), their families, and broader communities.

## Current Solutions and Their Limitations
Existing interventions include:  
- Community Management of Acute Malnutrition (CMAM) programs providing Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food (RUTF).  
- Manual Mid-Upper Arm Circumference (MUAC) screening by CHEWs.  
- NGO-led outreach and Primary Health Center (PHC) routine checks.  

Key limitations:  
- Very low coverage due to infrequent community outreach.  
- Delayed detection leading to progression from moderate to severe cases.  
- Overburdened frontline staff and high workload.  
- Insecurity restricting access in many areas.  
- Poor follow-up and limited real-time data for response planning.

## Proposed AI Opportunity
Develop a **hybrid mobile/USSD/SMS-based AI tool** that is offline-capable for early malnutrition risk detection. Users (caregivers or workers) can:  
- Input child data (age, weight, height) or take/upload an arm photo for MUAC estimation.  
- ML model predicts risk level (normal, moderate, severe) and provides immediate advice, referral guidance, and progress tracking.  
- Frontline workers receive decision support tools.  
- Ministries/NPHCDA get anonymized aggregated dashboards integrated with DHIS2 for identifying hotspots and resource allocation.

## Success Metrics
- **Reach**: 100,000+ users (including 20,000+ frontline workers) within 18 months.  
- **Impact**: 40% increase in early referrals; 25–35% reduction in progression from moderate to severe cases.  
- **Efficiency**: >85% model accuracy; 50% faster screening time; 70% user retention.  
- **Sustainability**: Cost per user <₦200 through NGO/government partnerships; integration into at least 3 state nutrition programs.

## Potential Data Sources
- Public: IPC reports, UNICEF/NDHS surveys, WHO child growth standards.  
- System-level: NPHCDA/DHIS2 records, CMAM program data (via partnerships).  
- Collected: Consent-based anonymized user/CHEW inputs for model training and validation.

## Partnerships
- FMOH/NPHCDA for policy alignment, data access, and scale-up.  
- NGOs (UNICEF, MSF, IRC) for ground-truth labels, pilot testing, and field validation.
